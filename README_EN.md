Ideal for programming beginners, digital artists, and graphic algorithm enthusiasts.

📌 Main features:
- Generate an image through code.
- Save a generated image.
- Extend the color palette using **RGB** values in hexadecimal or the format `(255,255,255,255)`.
- Efficient pixel matrix engine to represent and render graphics.
